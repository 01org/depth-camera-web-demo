After exploring possibility to implement JavaScript API that would fetch calibration parameters from camera ([link to outdated specification for the reference](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/WD-mediacapture-depth-20170328/)), that approach got abandoned calibration parameters are instead, specified in JavaScript code here, in [depth-camera.js](https://github.com/01org/depth-camera-web-demo/blob/926fd23c535e3a5a07fcfb94bf9afea0e31a9dc4/depth-camera.js#L149) file. Given that all RealSense cameras of the same model are factory calibrated to the same values and that firmware update (so far) doesn't change calibration parameters, specifying constant values in depth-camera.js and lookup based on camera label worked fine,... so far.

The section here explains where from, and how to, add numerical values to depth-camera.js file. This work is required for new camera models or if you want to support depth or color stream track resolutions that are not yet specified in depth-camera.js.

We would need [rs-enumerate-devices](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/master/tools/enumerate-devices) tool. It is part of RealSense SDK. Install SDK binary [binary or build it from source code](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/). Connect the camera and run ```rs-enumerate-devices -c``` to get the calibration data printed out to terminal. Copy values from there to depth-camera.js following the example:
